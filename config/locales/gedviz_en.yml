#
# General format:
#
# key: value
# -> Translate the value on the right side of the colon,
#    do not translate the key on the left side.
#
# Nesting:
#
# The keys are structured in a hierarchy and nested by indentation. Example:
#
# relation:
#   import: exported from %{from} to %{to}
#   claims: owed by %{to} to %{from}
#   migration: migrated from %{from} to %{to}
#
# The keys “import”, “claims” and “migration” are part of the “relation” group.
# The indentation uses two spaces (“  ”) per nesting level.
#
# Comments:
#
# Lines that start with a “#” (like these lines here) are English comments
# for translators and don’t need to be translated.
#
# Placeholders:
#
# import: exported from %{from} to %{to}
# -> Leave %{from} and %{to} unchanged. You can move them around
#    in the sentence, though
#
# HTML tags:
#
# Example:
# what_is_it_body: <p>GED VIZ is part of the <a href="http://www.ged-project.de/" target="_blank">Global Economic Dynamics (GED) project</a>.</p>
#
# Everything between < (less-than symbol) and > (bigger-than symbol) is
# an HTML tag. The HTML code is interpreted by the browser.
# The tag itself should remain unchanged. Please translate the text
# between <X> and </X>.
#
# Quick HTML reference: <p>…</p> is a paragraph, <a>…</a> is a link,
# <span>…</span> is a simple grouping element.
#
# The example above is shown as “GED VIZ is part of the Global Economic
# Dynamics (GED) project.” where “Global Economic Dynamics (GED) project”
# is a link.
